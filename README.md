# AP-Group-Project-2021

Grizzly's Entertainment is a stage equipment business that offers the rental of equipment
for events requiring staging, lighting, power, and sound. The managers of the company
are currently facing an issue scheduling the equipment for all the events for the upcoming
Jamaican Christmas holiday season. You are hired to write a software that will assist the
company in the management and scheduling of their assets.
Design a JAVA application that will meet the requirements. Your application should be
built using the Client/Server architecture. Your Database should be located on
the server machine where the client will make requests to the server over the network.
Your client application must send requests to the server application as only the server
application can establish connections to the database. The server will grant the
corresponding request from the client. Your application should be developed with a
graphical user interface that will aid the users of the system in their respective data
entry and processing. Please include a GUI to interact with the data for all
database tables. The server application need not have a GUI. However, you may include
graphical components to enhance user experience.

## Instructions:
1. System Name: Grizzlyâ€™s Entertainment Equipment Rental
2. Logging should be on both client side and server side
3. Use appropriate exception handling
4. Graphical User Interface should be implemented as a Multi-document Interface(MDI)
